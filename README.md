### Automated Detection of Non-Relevant Posts on the Russian Imageboard 2ch: Importance of the Choice of Word Representations

Repostiry with code, dataset and and links to the models proposed in the paper.

Results of the comparison of the word embedding models are in the Jupyter notebooks at the directory `paper`:

* `semantic_relatedness.ipynb` for the semantic relatedness task
* `word_similarity.ipynb` for the word similarity task

To reproduce the results of the experiments, download folders [`models`](https://yadi.sk/d/tFHYZcCQ3KxEac) and [`datasets`](https://yadi.sk/d/c_pg4k6b3KxEkr) and place them into `paper` folder. Then one can try to execute code in the notebooks.

`2SR` (which stands for *2ch Semantic Relatedness*) Dataset could be found at `paper/datasets`.
